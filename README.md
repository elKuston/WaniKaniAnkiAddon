# WaniKaniAnkiAddon
I've been using WaniKani for a while now, and one if its biggest flaws, I think, is that it is unidirectional, in the sense that you're asked what's the reading and the meaning of a certain word, say 食べる (to eat), however you're never asked to translate "to eat" into japanese. Therefore I feel like you do get much better at reading and understanding what you read, but when the time comes to speak or write, you may lack some knowledge. 

This is a simple Add-on that syncs WaniKani started (eg, completed the lesson) vocabulary, creating cards where the meaning(s) are the question and the kanji/reading the answer. It offers some customization options: first, obviously, you have to specify your WaniKani API Key. You can then choose the deck where all cards will be synced, and whether or not you want the pronunciation audio to be downloaded and included into the card (will be included by default).

It has not yet been widely tested, so it is possible that includes some bugs or glitches. Please feel free to open issues on github in such case.
